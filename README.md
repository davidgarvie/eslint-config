# ESLint Rules

Some opinionated rules on how to lint a Javascript project

To install: 

```bash
npm i @davidgarvie/eslint-config --save-dev
npx install-peerdeps @davidgarvie/eslint-config
```

To use, add the following to `.eslintrc.json`:
```json
{
  "extends": ["@davidgarvie"]
}
```

Note, these are mainly prettier and basic ESLint rules. I simply got bored of configuring linting rules on every new project.
